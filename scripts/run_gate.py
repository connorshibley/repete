"""Execute a frozen pre-registration and record the verdict.
`python scripts/run_gate.py <spec-id> [--workers N]`

Replaces the bespoke `scripts/gate_*.py` pattern — seven runners, 1,464 lines,
all doing the same five things around `backtest.simulate_ensemble`,
`backtest.enablement_gate` and `significance.compare`. Writing those by hand is
what capped how many hypotheses this project could test; the compute never was.

Three refusals, and they are the point
--------------------------------------
1. **Not registered.** No row in research/registrations.jsonl → there is no
   frozen pass mark, so any result would be unfalsifiable.
2. **Altered since registration.** The hash moved → the claim changed after it
   was frozen. The runner names the exact fields that differ, because
   "clauses.2.pp: 1.0 -> 3.0" is the finding, while "spec was altered" only
   starts a search.
3. **Snapshot drift.** The data's sha256 is not the one the registration named
   → this would be a different experiment wearing the same id.

Every existing gate script already refuses on (3). (1) and (2) are new, and they
are what makes pre-registration mechanical rather than a habit backed by a
commit. §33 RUN 1 is the standing reminder: it printed VALIDATED and was an
artifact of a runner detail nobody had frozen.

Determinism
-----------
`--workers` fans arms out across processes — the one place the Bizon's 64 cores
pay off, since arms are embarrassingly parallel. Results are collected back into
spec order, never completion order, and `significance.compare` carries a fixed
seed, so **the verdict cannot depend on how many workers ran it**. That is a
test (`test_run_gate_reproduces.py`), not a hope.

A verdict is a recommendation, never an action: nothing here enables a strategy
or widens a rail (CLAUDE.md invariant 2). The owner decides.
