"""Build a FROZEN bars snapshot for gate reproducibility.

Why this exists
---------------
Gate sections §1–§13 in `knowledge/backtest_candidates.md` were all scored on
one frozen file, `memory/bars_snapshot_2020_2026-07-10.json`. `memory/` is in
`.gitignore`, so that file was never committed — and it is now gone. Every
number those sections quote is, today, **unreproducible**. That is a process
bug, not bad luck: a snapshot that a gate depends on must live in version
control next to the verdicts it supports.

So snapshots now land in `data/snapshots/` (committed) and carry a SHA256 in
`data/snapshots/MANIFEST.json`. `--verify` re-hashes and fails loudly on drift,
which is what makes "re-running §14 reproduces §14" a checkable claim rather
than a hope.

Source: yfinance. No API keys, so any future session can rebuild without
credentials — that is the whole point.

    python scripts/build_snapshot.py                 # build the default snapshot
    python scripts/build_snapshot.py --verify        # check hashes, touch nothing

NOT interchangeable with the old file
-------------------------------------
yfinance serves split/dividend-ADJUSTED closes; the retired Alpaca snapshot
served raw prices. Same tickers, different numbers. Any strategy comparison
must therefore re-measure its baseline *inside this snapshot* — carrying a
figure across the two is comparing two different datasets. Sections written
against this file say so in their header.
