"""Has the edge decayed? Compare realised trades against random entries.

Why this exists
---------------
The daily-loss kill switch (`risk.engage_halt`) answers "am I losing money too
fast". It does NOT answer "did my entry signal stop carrying information".
Those are different failure modes: a strategy that has been arbitraged away
bleeds slowly and never trips a loss limit. Nothing in this repo measured that
until now.

The null being tested
---------------------
*Would entering on random dates have done as well?*

Random entries are drawn on the SAME symbols, over the SAME bar series, with a
holding-period distribution RESAMPLED FROM THE ACTUAL TRADES, and the same
slippage model. Matching exposure is what makes the comparison honest — an
unmatched null holds a different amount of market risk and will read as "edge"
in any up market.

The verdict is a percentile: where does the strategy's mean return per trade sit
inside the distribution of means that random timing would have produced?

Pre-registered thresholds (frozen before first run, see
knowledge/backtest_candidates.md §RANDOM-ENTRY DECAY MONITOR)
------------------------------------------------------------
  percentile < 5.0     -> WORSE_THAN_RANDOM          (alert)
  5.0 <= pct < 95.0    -> INDISTINGUISHABLE_FROM_RANDOM
  percentile >= 95.0   -> BEATS_RANDOM
  n_trades < min_trades-> INSUFFICIENT_DATA          (never a pass)

INSUFFICIENT_DATA is a distinct state on purpose. A monitor that returns
"healthy" on an empty book is the "empty is not the same as absent" trap, and
this repo has been bitten by it before.

Known asymmetry, stated rather than hidden
------------------------------------------
Real trades carry stops and take-profits; these null trades do not — they enter,
hold, and exit at the close. Resampling the REALISED holding periods absorbs
much of this (a trade stopped out on day 2 contributes a 2-bar holding), but not
all of it: an unprotected null takes the full loss where a real trade cut it.
That biases the null DOWNWARD, which makes the strategy look better, which makes
this monitor **lenient** — it will under-fire rather than over-fire. Erring
toward under-firing is the right direction for an alert whose false positives
cost attention, but it must not be mistaken for a conservative test of edge.

No network, no I/O, deterministic seed — callers pass bars in. Same shape as
`scorecard.py` and `significance.py`.
