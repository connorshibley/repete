"""Dead-man watchdog — the bot must fail LOUDLY when it runs unattended.

Scheduled ~30 min after the daily cycle (see scripts/
com.trading-agent.watchdog.plist). Checks FIVE things and alerts via an
operator notification + log + ledger event when any of them fails:

  1. HEARTBEAT — did the PROCESS run? memory/heartbeat (written on every
     run_cycle exit path) must be from today (local). Missing/old on a weekday
     means the cycle never started — launchd broke, the venv broke, or the
     machine slept through it.
  2. CYCLE_COMPLETE — did the cycle FINISH? A `cycle_complete` record dated
     today must exist in the ledger.
  3. MARKET_CONTEXT — did it KNOW anything? Added 2026-07-29 (W6-A3), after the
     10:34 ET news refresh lost all eleven RSS feeds and the Alpaca wire to DNS
     failure and said so in one INFO line nobody reads. Checked only once the
     cycle completed, so a broken cycle reports its root cause rather than two
     symptoms. ALERT ONLY — news is fail-soft and never gates trading.
  4. HALT: if the kill-switch HALT file exists, keep reminding the owner
     every day until they deal with it.
  5. DRAWDOWN LATCH: if the drawdown circuit breaker is engaged, say so every
     day until it is cleared. Added 2026-08-03. §40 showed the rail is a
     ONE-WAY LATCH — the equity peak ratchets up and never down, so once
     entries are blocked the book goes to cash, equity stops moving, the peak
     never falls, and the bot never buys again. It blocked 99.43% of buy
     signals in 2022-2026 and has never tripped in production, which is
     exactly why it would engage in silence. ALERT ONLY — nothing here blocks
     or unblocks a cycle, and §41/§44 both REJECTED candidate fixes, so the
     latch itself is untouched.

Check 2 exists because check 1 cannot see a cycle that started and died.
`write_heartbeat()` runs in a `finally:`, so a crashed cycle stamps a FRESH
heartbeat on its way out and reads as healthy. That is what happened on Friday
2026-07-24: the 15:45 cycle died about six seconds in, this watchdog said
nothing, `catchup` used the same test and so silenced its own recovery, and the
EOD post read exactly like a quiet market. It cost a full trading day and went
unnoticed for two.

Added 2026-07-26. `check()`'s own docstring has described all three since; THIS
docstring said "two things" until 2026-07-29 (W5-5) — the file contradicted
itself, and the stale half was the one you read first.

Alerts degrade gracefully (a notification failure still logs); the watchdog
itself never raises.
