  * max trades per day (order-rate circuit breaker)
  * daily loss limit -> flatten everything + write a HALT file
  * HALT file check: if present, the bot refuses to trade until you delete it

    Why this exists (2026-08-03)
    ----------------------------
    §40 established that the breaker is a ONE-WAY LATCH and that this is a live
    defect, not a backtest artifact. `update_high_water` ratchets the peak up
    and never down — correct on its own terms, since a peak that followed
    equity downward could never fire — but combined with entries-blocked it has
    no recovery path:

        equity peaks at P -> a >=limit drawdown blocks every entry -> open
        positions exit normally and the book goes to cash -> in cash equity is
        FLAT at ~P*(1-limit) -> the peak stays P -> the drawdown stays >=limit
        -> the bot never buys again, for the rest of the run.

    In 2022-2026 that blocked 99.43% of every buy signal. Production has not
    tripped it yet (§40 measured 9.85pp of headroom), which is precisely why
    nobody has felt it.

    §41 (decay at unchanged sizing) and §44 (decay plus reduced sizing) both
    tested candidate FIXES and both were REJECTED, so `risk.drawdown_decay`
    stays absent and the latch stays. **This function does not change that and
    is not a fix.** It makes the state legible so a silent permanent kill
    switch becomes a loud one a human can clear. It moves no threshold and
    blocks nothing.

    ONE implementation on purpose: `health.status()` and `watchdog.check()`
    both read it. Two hand-rolled copies of this arithmetic would be free to
    disagree about when the rail is engaged, which is the class of divergence
    this repo numbers.

    stop contributes the standard per-trade risk fraction of equity

    The magnitude is direction-dependent: a long's stop sits below entry
    (entry - stop), a short's sits above it (stop - entry). Before this fix
    the formula was always (entry - stop) clamped at 0 — for a short that
    clamp fired on every position (entry - stop is negative for a correctly
    placed short stop), so a short's real risk contributed exactly 0.0 to
    the cap, invisibly. `rec["action"]` (as written by main.py's open_trades
    entries) selects the formula; a record with no `action` key — every
    record written before this fix — defaults to the long formula, so
    existing/legacy books are read exactly as before.

    The `max(..., 0.0)` clamp survives on BOTH sides, unchanged in spirit:

    claims — a long with its stop above entry, or a short with its stop
