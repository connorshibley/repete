"""Intraday opportunity scan — swing_sectors' 30-minute trigger loop.

    python src/swing_scan.py        (launchd: every 30 min, 09:35-15:35 ET)

Owner direction, 2026-08-11: the bot should act when it sees opportunity, not
at a fixed time. This module is how that happens WITHOUT re-opening §19a:

  * Every condition and every level comes from `swing_sectors.assess()` on
    COMPLETED daily bars — the same function, the same numbers, that the
    15:45 cycle and the §62 gate see. Nothing here computes an indicator
    from a forming bar. What this module adds is one comparison: is the
    LIVE quote inside a zone that was fully determined by completed bars?
    That is the same standing as a broker-side bracket stop, which also
    waits on live price all day.
  * `opportunity_scan.py` (alerts-only) is unchanged and its no-order-verbs
    test still binds. THIS module may trade — exactly one strategy, exactly
    one direction (a long swing entry), through the same pipeline the cycle
    uses: judge review, hard rails, brackets, ledger, journal.

WHAT A PASS DOES. Bootstrap exactly as a cycle does (`main._bootstrap_cycle`:
preflight fail-safe, HALT semantics, broker state), fetch completed bars
through the same rails (`main._fetch_and_validate_bars`: staleness, universe
floor, vendor cross-check, regime), rank the sector cross-section, and ask
`assess()` for armed symbols. A live quote inside an armed zone is a
candidate. With `swing_sectors.enabled: false` the pass LOGS the candidate
and places nothing — the dry-run mode the strategy ships in. Enabled, the
candidate goes through `_enter()`, which mirrors main.py's `_process_signal`
entry path step for step (the order of guards is load-bearing; see each
comment there for why).

AT MOST ONE ENTRY PER PASS, deepest laggard first. The rails would allow
more, but each entry re-prices the account, and 30 minutes later the next
pass judges the next candidate against the book as it actually is — not
against a cycle-start snapshot three entries stale.

WHY A PASS EXITS QUIETLY. A skip is a success. Most passes find nothing, and
a scan that wrote a ledger event every 30 minutes would bury the record it
exists to keep. The ledger hears about candidates, entries, and failures —
never about "nothing happened".

WHAT THIS MODULE NEVER DOES: exits. Broker-side bracket stops protect
continuously; strategy exits (thesis complete / base failed / time stop) run
in the daily cycle via the ownership rule, where every exit for every
strategy runs. A second exit path would be a second implementation of the
ownership rule.
