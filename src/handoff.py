"""One self-describing record per cycle: what changed, what it cost, what is
still at risk, what is unresolved, and what runs next.

Why this exists (2026-09-08)
----------------------------
Borrowed, deliberately, from a tutorial that got this part right: *"save what
changed, actual outcomes, remaining risk, unresolved issues, and the exact
next job — even on a no-trade day."* The ledger already holds every one of
those facts, scattered across decision rows, outcome rows, health, the
drawdown rail and the scheduler's job table. Reconstructing "what is this bot
doing and what happens next" meant joining five sources by hand, which is why
nobody did it and why a week-long outage went unnoticed in August.

**Even on a no-trade day** is the load-bearing clause. A bot that records
nothing when it does nothing is indistinguishable from a bot that is dead —
this project has now been bitten by that twice (the 2026-07-24 crashed cycle
that stamped a fresh heartbeat, and the 2026-08-21→28 blocked-entry outage).
A handoff row on a quiet day is the difference between "quiet" and "silent".

Contract
--------
- **Never raises.** `record()` swallows everything. Instrumentation that can
  take down a trading cycle is a worse bug than the one it reports.
- **Its own event.** `cycle_complete`'s position in the ledger is load-bearing
  (`_finalize_cycle`, and the watchdog keys off it); this sits outside that
  contract exactly as `cycle_timing` does, and cannot disturb it.
- **Absent is never zero.** Every field that could not be computed is `None`
  and says so. A handoff claiming `unresolved: []` when health could not be
  read would be the flattering-instrument failure this repo keeps cataloguing.
