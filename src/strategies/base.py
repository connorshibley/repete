"""Shared strategy primitives: the Signal contract and pure indicators.

Every strategy module is deterministic plain code — the LLM never generates
signals. Modules follow a duck-typed contract:

    NAME: str
    NEEDS_CROSS_SECTION: bool
    def required_lookback(params) -> int
    NEEDS_ENTRY_TS: bool                        # optional, default False
    NEEDS_POSITION_SIDE: bool                   # optional, default False
    def prepare(all_bars, params, cfg=None) -> ctx   # cross-sectional only
    def generate(symbol, bars, params, holding, cross_section=None) -> Signal

`prepare` receives `cfg` as well as its own `params` because a cross-section can
depend on config outside the strategy's sub-dict (`reclaim` reads the top-level
`sectors:` map). `generate` deliberately does NOT: everything it needs must be
carried in the `cross_section` context `prepare` built, which keeps per-symbol
signal generation a pure function of (bars, params, ctx).

`NEEDS_ENTRY_TS = True` makes `strategies.generate` pass `entry_ts=` through —
required by any strategy with a max-hold rule. It is DECLARED rather than
inferred from the module name; the dispatch used to test `name == "meanrev"`,
which silently gave a second such strategy `entry_ts=None` and a max-hold that
measured nothing.

`NEEDS_POSITION_SIDE = True` makes it pass `position_side=` — `"long"`,
`"short"` or `None` when flat. `holding: bool` says only THAT a position exists,
never which way it points, and for a strategy with a short leg that is not
enough to choose an exit action:

    the owner-only exit branch (main.py) calls generate(owner, ..., True, ...)
    for any held name. Asked about a SHORT with only `holding=True` to go on,
    a long-biased strategy answers "sell" — which EXIT_ACTIONS accepts and
    broker.market_order maps to SELL, DOUBLING the short instead of closing it.

Declared, not inferred, for the same reason as NEEDS_ENTRY_TS: a strategy that
silently receives `None` where it expected a side does not fail, it just decides
wrongly. Every strategy that does not declare it keeps its exact call signature,
so adding the flag cannot move a strategy that has no short leg.

    A signed quantity is the input on purpose. `broker.positions()` copies
    Alpaca's own `float(p.qty)`, negative for a short, and main.py's in-cycle
    view was made to match that sign in Phase 2-C. Deriving the side anywhere

    — would be a second source of truth for something the position record

    Ranked against itself rather than against a fixed threshold because there
    is no such thing as a universally narrow range: XLU's quiet is XLE's storm,
    and 2017's quiet is not 2008's. A percentile is the only form of this
    statistic that means the same thing on every symbol in a cross-section,
    which is what an ensemble rail needs.

    Volatility clustering is the empirical fact this leans on, and it is chosen
    partly BECAUSE it is not a return anomaly — a premium can be arbitraged
    away once published, whereas the tendency of quiet periods to sit next to
    quiet periods is a property of the price process itself.

    Needs `period + lookback` bars: `lookback` historical values of a statistic
    that each need `period` bars. Returns None below that, and callers FAIL
    OPEN on None — so a caller that is never given enough history silently
    blocks nothing. `strategies.max_lookback_bars` is what stops that being the
    normal case; see the note there.

    The rank is STRICT (`<`, not `<=`), so a flat series of identical ratios
    scores 0.0 rather than 50.0. That polarity is chosen on purpose: a symbol
    whose range never moves is genuinely coiled, and the alternative would have
    a dead instrument read as average.

    THE ARITHMETIC IS RESTATED HERE RATHER THAN LOOPING OVER `range_ratio`,
    and that duplication is a measured choice, not an oversight. The natural
    form — `range_ratio(bars[:len(bars) - i], period)` for each i — slices the
    whole (multi-thousand-bar) list `lookback` times and re-runs a Python-level
    `float()` over every element, which is three orders of magnitude slower
    than this and would dominate the runtime of every gate that turns the rail
    on. `test_contraction.py` pins the two against each other on the final
    window, so the copy cannot drift from the original without a red test.
