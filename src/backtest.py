"""Offline backtest harness — replays historical daily bars through the SAME
deterministic code the live bot uses (`strategy.generate_signal`, `strategy.atr`,
`risk.size_order`, `risk.pure_checks`) with a fee/slippage model.

Isolation guarantees:
  * never imports Ledger/Memory/llm/x_poster — the live audit trail, learnings
    and X posting are untouchable from here;
  * the only file it writes is the trials log (DEFAULT_TRIALS_PATH below,
    append-only — every parameter variant tried is recorded, per the
    False-Strategy-Theorem discipline in GUIDE.md);
  * `broker` is imported lazily inside fetch_bars() only when no --bars-file is
    given, and only for READ-ONLY market data.

Anti-look-ahead: signals are computed on the close of bar i and filled at the
OPEN of bar i+1, with slippage charged against you on every fill. Bracket legs
are checked intrabar pessimistically (stop before take-profit when both touch).

Usage:
    python src/backtest.py --bars-file data/bars.json --fast 5 10 --slow 20 30
    python src/backtest.py --symbols SPY --start 2020-01-01 --end 2026-01-01

    Why this exists (2026-07-23)
    ----------------------------
    `simulate()` above replays ONE strategy in isolation. The live bot runs the
    whole ensemble against a SINGLE set of rails — one cash balance, one global
    `max_open_positions` ceiling, one `max_trades_per_day` counter, one
    portfolio-heat budget, one correlation cap. So every gate verdict in
    `knowledge/backtest_candidates.md` describes a bot that does not exist.

    That is not a hypothetical. §19b tried to gate `max_trades_per_day` and got
    four BYTE-IDENTICAL arms, because `risk._trades_today()` counts the whole
    ensemble while the simulator was watching one strategy that never came near
    the cap. It is the third sim/live divergence found in two days, after the
    missing heat/correlation caps (§13) and the fill-timing gap (§19a).

    Relationship to simulate()
    --------------------------
    This is a SIBLING, not a replacement. `simulate()` stays byte-stable so the
    §14–§19 numbers remain re-derivable. The correctness argument is that with
    exactly one strategy enabled, this function must reproduce `simulate()`
    trade-for-trade — `tests/test_ensemble_sim.py` asserts precisely that, for
    each strategy. Ensemble behaviour is then single-strategy behaviour plus
    contention, and nothing else.

    Shared vs per-strategy
    ----------------------
    shared:        cash/equity, global max_open_positions, the per-day trade
                   counter, portfolio heat, the correlation cap
    per-strategy:  params, re-entry cooldown (§9), the chandelier trailing gate
                   (§7, tsmom only), and the §13 slot allocation

    `strategy_overrides` maps strategy name -> params to overlay (and may set
    `enabled`), so a gate can vary one strategy's settings — or turn one off —
    without touching the live config.

    # §40 asked how capital gets IN. Nothing had ever asked how it gets OUT,
    # even though every closed trade has carried an `exit_reason` since the
    # simulator was written; it was aggregated nowhere. The live book turns over
    # at 0.27 closes/day, which puts Invariant 10's >=30 closed trades ~98 days
    # out — later than the >=60-day clock — so the close rate, not the calendar,
    # is what gates revenue, and it had never been measured.
    #
    # `end_of_data` is the bucket that matters. It is a FORCED close at run end,
    # not a decision, and live has no equivalent — nothing force-closes a real
    # position. Every trade in that bucket is one the strategies never chose to
    # sell, so a backtest's closed-trade count is inflated by run truncation to
    # exactly that extent.
