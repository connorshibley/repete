"""The §52 EDGE freeze, and the probe that justifies it (2026-08-03).

Why this file exists
--------------------
§51 produced this project's only EDGE pass in fifteen claims — and its own
write-up showed the pass is explicable by survivorship. The 38-name universe
carries **+200.28pp** of inflation, because those names are in `config.yaml`
precisely BECAUSE they are today's winners.

§51 named the fix: replicate on a universe not selected on the outcome.
`scripts/probe_delisted_coverage.py` asked whether that is buildable and
REFUSED, for two separate reasons:

  * yfinance returns NO history for SIVB, FRC, TWTR or ATVI — the losers are
    simply absent, which is the survivorship bias itself;
  * SBNY returns 475 bars that ALL POSTDATE the bank's 2023-03-12 seizure by
    seventeen months, still labelled "Signature Bank", on the pink sheets. A
    builder checking only "did we get bars?" would splice in a successor and
    produce a dataset that never observes the collapse. **That is worse than
    the bias**, and it is why check 2 exists at all.

So `register_gate.py` refuses new EDGE claims on `data/snapshots/`. This is
§33's argument — "continuing to hunt arms is simply buying more chances for a
false positive" — applied to the DATA rather than the selection procedure, and
it is mechanical for the reason §36 gave: a discipline that is only a habit
gets forgotten by the next session.

What these tests protect, each pinned in both directions:

  * the freeze BINDS on new EDGE claims, and does NOT bind on DIAGNOSTIC /
    METHOD / CAPACITY — a freeze that stopped everything would be abandoned;
  * it does NOT break already-registered specs — the machinery it guards has to
    keep working, or the freeze becomes the outage;
  * the override WORKS and COSTS something — a wall gets edited out of the
    script, a speed bump with an audit trail does not;
  * the probe's check 2 catches ticker reuse, which check 1 alone cannot see.
