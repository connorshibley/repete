"""DIVERGENCE #11 — the live equity peak was only sampled when an order ran.

The defect
----------
§31 put `risk.update_high_water` inside `risk.pre_trade_checks`, and reasoned
carefully about running it for sells as well as buys so "the peak must keep
tracking even while entries are blocked". That reasoning is right and it is not
enough, because `pre_trade_checks` has exactly one caller (`main.py`'s order
loop) and it fires **only when an order is attempted**.

A cycle that generates no buy and no sell therefore never touched the mark.

Why that is not cosmetic, given the peak only ratchets UP: equity earned on a
quiet day is invisible to it. A book that drifts up over a week of holds keeps
last week's peak, and the first 10% drawdown is then measured from a stale LOW
peak — so the breaker fires late. Symmetrically, a genuine new high never
registers, and the bot sits nearer the rail than its equity says.

It is divergence #10 one level up. There the SIMULATOR ratcheted only inside
the buy branch; here LIVE ratchets only inside an order attempt. Both are
invisible on the 500-symbol snapshots, where something trades on virtually
every bar — and both bite hardest on the book this bot actually runs: 38
symbols, with whole days where nothing is entered.

What closes it
--------------
A ratchet in the cycle itself, immediately after the account is read fresh from
the broker (invariant #4) and before any decision is taken, so the mark cannot
depend on what the cycle chooses to do. `pre_trade_checks` still ratchets per
order; this is the floor under it, not a replacement, and `update_high_water`
is max-based so running both is a no-op the second time.
