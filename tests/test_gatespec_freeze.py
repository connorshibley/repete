"""You cannot move a goalpost after seeing the data.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Every rejection in `knowledge/backtest_candidates.md` means something only
because the claim, arms, pass mark and honest prior were committed BEFORE the
runner existed. That has been enforced by discipline and a git commit. Once
gates are declared as data and executed by a generic runner, discipline is not
enough — a one-character edit to a threshold would silently rewrite what
"passing" meant.

§33 RUN 1 is the standing reminder of the cost: it printed VALIDATED and was an
artifact of a runner detail nobody had frozen. It stayed in the record instead
of being tidied away.

So the freeze is mechanical, and these are the tests that make it real:

  * a spec that was never registered cannot be scored
  * a spec altered after registration cannot be scored, AND the refusal names
    the field that moved — "clauses.2.pp: 1.0 -> 3.0" is the finding; "the spec
    was altered" only starts a search
  * reformatting is NOT alteration; a freeze that cries wolf gets bypassed
  * re-registering is fine before a verdict exists and refused after it

`test_a_registered_unaltered_spec_is_accepted` is the permissive half. Without
it, a `check_frozen` that raised unconditionally would pass every test above.
