"""Every broker-shaped test double is either complete or explicitly excused.

WHY (Phase 5a, 2026-08-06)
--------------------------
`src/main.py` wraps two broker calls in `except Exception` and carries on:

    main.py:1536  latest_price()      -> drift guard skipped, `degradation` logged
    main.py:397   open_stop_orders()  -> the whole chandelier ratchet skipped

Both are correct for a real outage and both are indistinguishable, from inside
a test, from "the fake forgot the method". So an incomplete double does not
fail — it quietly selects a different branch and then agrees with whatever
happens there.

Both had already fired:

  * `FakeCycleBroker` (imported by nine files) had no `latest_price`. Every
    `run_cycle()` it drove skipped the drift guard and wrote a spurious
    `degradation` — the event counted against `ops.max_degradations_per_day`.
  * `_ScriptedCycleBroker` had no `open_stop_orders`. That one never fired only
    because `update_trailing_stops` returns early on `trailing_atr_mult: 0`.
    Enabling the trail in any test there would have skipped the entire ratchet
    and still passed.

Phase 6 is about to move a 692-line function. A net woven from doubles like
that would certify the refactor against the fail-open branch.

THE RULE HERE is the one Phase 4's write-retry exclusion uses: no silent
bucket. Every broker-shaped class is NAMED below as conformant or exempt with a
reason, so a double added later fails this file until somebody decides which it
is. `test_the_registry_matches_reality` is what makes that stick.
