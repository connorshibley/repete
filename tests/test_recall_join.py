"""The §↔spec join, derived twice and refusing when the derivations disagree.

Nothing in this repo mapped §57 to `s57a-d` before this. The mapping existed
only in prose and in spec header comments, which is a naming habit wearing the
clothes of a fact. So it is derived two ways — from the identifier and from the
spec file's own header — and a disagreement raises instead of picking a winner.
