"""What happens when rails fire TOGETHER (2026-08-02).

Why this file exists
--------------------
`test_rails_are_live.py` proves each rail exists and sits at its threshold, one
rail at a time, by pairing an allowed call with a neighbouring blocked one. That
was the answer to the 2026-07-27 audit, where replacing the whole engine with
`return None` left 13 safety tests green.

It leaves a second gap. The rails are a strict first-match-wins `raise` sequence
across `pure_checks` and `pre_trade_checks`, so two things are only decidable
when more than one rail is breached at once:

  1. WHICH rail gets reported. `RiskRejection.rail` is the name an operator reads
     during an incident. Before this file, NO test anywhere asserted on `.rail`,
     so re-ordering two checks would silently change the diagnosis while every
     test stayed green.

  2. Whether an EXIT can be trapped. Entry rails are individually exempt for
     sells, but "each rail lets a sell through on its own" is not the same claim
     as "a sell gets out when the whole book is on fire". The second is the one
     that matters, and it is the one nothing tested.

Two live defects were found by asking those questions; the tests that drive them
are marked DEFECT below.

All tests here are offline and side-effect free, or run under `monkeypatch.chdir`
— `pre_trade_checks` ratchets `memory/.equity_highwater.json` and reads
`memory/.trade_counts.json`, both RELATIVE paths, so an unisolated test would
mutate the live deployment's state.

#
# `max_trades_per_day: 15` is live, `record_trade()` is called for buys AND
# sells (main.py, unconditional after the order), and the check carried no
# action guard. So a day that reaches 15 total trades refused the next EXIT and
# left the position open past its exit signal.
#
# The runaway-guard rationale in risk.py is entry-side by construction: it
# bounds "an API loop, a bad feed, or a signal bug that would otherwise place
# orders until buying power ran out". None of those is a reason to refuse a sell
# — refusing the sell is how a control enlarges risk through its own limit.
