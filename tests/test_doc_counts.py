"""The numbers in the front-door docs are regenerated and checked, never typed.

WHY (Phase 8, 2026-08-06)
-------------------------
`README.md` is the artifact. It is also maintained by hand, and by 2026-08-06 it
was wrong in four measured places at once:

    tests               claimed 1,881      actual 1,967 (2,006 with #103)
    tests, again        `# 1881` in the quick-start block
    divergences         claimed 17, four open     actual 18, five open
    closed round-trips  claimed 8                 actual 10

That is the third time the test count has gone stale. A repo whose entire pitch
is "every number carries its benchmark and its sample size" cannot have a front
page that is wrong about its own sample sizes.

`docs/divergences.md` was worse, and this file found it. The prose said
**eighteen** and named **five** open; the summary table listed **fourteen** rows
and showed **one** open, because rows 13-16 had never been added. The table is
the fastest thing in the file to read and therefore the thing most likely to be
read alone — so the most-read summary undercounted the open divergences five to
one. Nothing compared the three statements, so nothing caught it.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* CHECKED HERE
---------------------------------------
The live round-trip count. `memory/ledger.jsonl` is gitignored — it does not
exist in a worktree and it does not exist on a CI runner. A test asserting it
would be skipped everywhere it ever ran, which is the "check that cannot fail"
this repo keeps catching (`ci.yml:55-69` applies the same reasoning to
`check_secret_exposure.py`). So `test_the_live_trade_count_is_checked_only_where
_a_ledger_exists` runs the check when a ledger is present and says **SKIPPED**
out loud when it is not, exactly as the backup drill's off-host check does.

THE EDGE TALLY (added 2026-08-15)
--------------------------------
The bottom half of this file pins the Bonferroni budget the front-door docs
state against `research/registrations.jsonl`, which owns it. It is here because
the *skills* got the same guard first and the docs did not: after §72 took K to
16, `GLOSSARY.md` went on saying **"K = 15 here, and the tally is 1 pass in
15"** in two places and `research/candidates_2026-08.md` quoted it as the
project's base rate. `README.md` had been updated. Nothing compared them.

That is the same defect this file already exists for — a count copied into
prose drifts from the ledger that owns it — with one extra lesson. The guard
that *should* have caught it globbed `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, so the fix
for a stale-number class of bug was itself scoped to a directory. Hence
`test_every_doc_that_states_a_k_is_either_checked_or_deliberately_exempt`
below: a new markdown file that states a K has to be classified before it can
sit in the repo unchecked.
