"""Scoring 55 frozen predictions against what actually happened.

`prior` is mandatory on every spec and `research/README.md` says why: it is
"the only thing that makes a surprise legible afterwards." Fifty-five of them
were written, hashed before the run, and never once read back.

The readings are a SIDECAR and must stay one. `gatespec.canonical()` hashes the
whole parsed spec and `register_gate.py` refuses re-registration once a verdict
exists, so no field can be added to any of the 55 frozen specs — not now, not
ever. That constraint is what these tests protect.
