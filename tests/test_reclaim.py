"""The `reclaim` leg: sector ranking, the base-then-reclaim trigger, the two
new rails, and the per-strategy universe.

Boundary pairs throughout, in the style of test_short_rails.py and
test_credit_gate.py: every blocked case sits beside a permitted one differing in
exactly the thing under test. A rail that refused everything would satisfy the
blocked half alone, and so would a strategy that never signalled — which is the
specific way this strategy can fail invisibly, since "never fires" and "fires
and finds nothing" produce identical gate output.
