"""The ensemble simulator (backtest.simulate_ensemble).

Why it exists: `simulate()` replays ONE strategy against the rails; the live bot
runs the whole ensemble against ONE shared set of them. Every gate verdict in
knowledge/backtest_candidates.md was therefore measured on a bot that does not
exist — which is how §19b managed to produce four byte-identical arms.

The load-bearing test here is `test_single_strategy_matches_simulate`: with one
strategy enabled the ensemble must reproduce `simulate()` trade-for-trade. If it
does, ensemble behaviour is single-strategy behaviour plus contention and
nothing else, which is the whole correctness argument. If it drifts, every §20
number is suspect.
